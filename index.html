        <p class="content__paragraph">Through my decades in sports recovery, I’ve seen how lower back pain can affect people physically, mentally and emotionally. (If you’re an athlete like I am, you know how frustrating it feels to have pain keep you from doing what you love.)</p>
        <p class="content__paragraph content__paragraph--blue">That’s why I packed this book with the most actionable information possible. This isn’t a “read it and forget it” guide. It’s a framework you can implement TODAY to get on the road to recovery.</p>

        <p class="content__paragraph">These three gamechangers are stepping stones to the final stage in your recovery: adding a load. This stage isn’t included in your book because performing that step too soon will result in failure. (But when you’ve progressed through the three steps above, you can ​learn all about adding a load here​.) Remember, designing your roadmap is the first step to a successful recovery. That’s exactly why I made it the focus of your free book.</p>
